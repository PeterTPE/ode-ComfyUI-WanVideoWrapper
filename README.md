new odev2 with lora

\\The ode v2 version is a creative sampler characterized by low contrast, near-realistic quality, and artistic creation. It can only be used with high noise for 6 steps, low noise for 2 steps, and a middle split step of 4 steps. It requires a unique LoRA, which is currently in training and undergoing refinement, and is only in the testing phase. This version offers multiple options for you to choose from, and my recommendation is to go with robust-smooth or even lower. Stay tuned for the official release.
